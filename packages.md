## State Management

1. [Mobx](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx)

	- `Observables` - represent the reactive-state of your application.
		- `@observable`
		- `@readonly`
		- `@computed`
	- `Actions` - how you mutate the observables.
	- `Reactions` - They are the observers of the reactive-system and get notified whenever an observable they track is changed.
